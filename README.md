Fonts used by MS Office are only stored in the local user account under \AppData\Local\Microsoft\FontCache\4\CloudFonts\Aptos and not in the system wide C:\Windows\Fonts. 
I have retrieved the Aptos fonts and packaged them into an MSI installer.
This brings the Aptos fonts directly into C:\Windows\Fonts, making it accessible for all programs such as Adobe.
